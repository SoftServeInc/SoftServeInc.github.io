# Key Features



<div class='half column'>
	<h2>Work Item Creation</h2>
	<p>Any TFS work items can be easily created with a “select and click” feature. SALMA supports all the necessary formats (rich text, images, graphics, and tables) to create work items descriptions and provide additional information directly from a MS Word document. You can link any element within a chosen document as well as outside of it, thus using external elements and links when needed.</p>
	<h2>Free for Use and Extend</h2>
	<p>SALMA is released under LGPL v.3.0 license so you are welcome to use it for free and extend for your needs.</p>

	<h2>Generate Documentation from Work Items</h2>
	<p>The data from TFS is extracted into a Word document based on existing queries with the possibility to rearrange and save the hierarchy. The data can be fully presented for subsequent data processing (such as progress analysis, report generation, and review) or reused in other projects.</p>
	<h2>Data Analysis and Manipulation</h2>
	<p>With SALMA, you can receive TFS updates on the status of the work items you`ve created from a Word document, and perform an operational and historical assessment of the project status by analyzing dependencies — relations between design artifacts — in a traceability matrix (for example, requirements and tests, errors and tests, etc.).</p>
